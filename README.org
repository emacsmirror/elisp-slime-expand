* elisp-slime-expand

  This minor mode adds similar functionality to the SLIME macroexpand
  mode.  It's activated using /C-x RET/ and then support further
  macro expansion in the macro view.  It also does macroexpand-all
  using /C-x M-m/.

  Once in the macroexpand view /g/ can be used to refresh the macro
  expansion and /q/ will bury the buffer.
